## About

<p>I created this project as a participant of a boot camp for web development focusing on React and Typescript. It was developed over the course of a single day in Visual Studio Code using HTML, CSS and Typescript.</p>

<p>The goal of this project was to spend the time deepening an understanding of Typescript functions in the framework of the second module of the bootcamp.</p>

## Design

The playful, colourful design for this web calculator was inspired by both the flat, angular design of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/12909522--dailyui-Mortgage-Calculator" title="Sebastian Vigil - Mortgage Calculator">Sebastian Vigil's "Mortgage Calculator"</a>, as well as its vibrant blue, and the layout and colour assortment of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/15359416-MechaCalc-Calculator-App" title="Afrills - MechaCalc - Calculator App">Afrills' "MechaCalc - Calculator App"</a>. This combination makes for a modern look while 
ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing user experience.
